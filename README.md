My First Project with HTML & CSS
Welcome to my very first project built using HTML and CSS! This project is a simple webpage that showcases my initial steps into the world of web development.

Introduction
This project was created as a part of my learning journey into web development. The webpage consists of a clean and simple design with basic layout elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and buttons. The primary goal of this project was to understand the fundamentals of HTML for structure and CSS for styling.

Features
Responsive Design: The layout is responsive, making it accessible on various devices including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Custom Fonts: I used the 'Roboto Mono' font to give the webpage a clean, modern look.
Hover Effects: Buttons include subtle hover effects to improve user interactivity.
Profile Card: A profile card with an image and basic information is the central focus of this project.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and content of the webpage.
CSS3: For styling the webpage, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
